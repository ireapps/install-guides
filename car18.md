# NICAR 2018 install guide

Drop by our [install party](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3189/3588/) at 10:15 a.m. on Sunday, March 11, in Clark, and we'll help you get your rig set up.

![ow wow](gifs/judgejudy.gif "judge judy can't even with this")

_Meantime_, Here's how IRE set up the PC and Mac laptops for #NICAR18. (Keep in mind that you may not need _all_ of these tools at once.)

A note on Python packages: To simplify things, we didn't use virtual environments to isolate dependencies for each Python session. You should do this for your projects, though! A variety of tools can help you manage project dependencies in a virtual environment, including [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (plus, optionally, [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). (The conference computers have `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` available, FWIW.)

Also, we didn't include instructions for setting up a virtualbox to run the programs used in the ["CAR Throwback" session](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3189/3666/). (If you really get the urge to party like it's 1998, let us know and we'll hook you up.)
